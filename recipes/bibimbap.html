<h2>Bibimbap, a warm Korean rice bowl topped with veggies and meat, is a filling meal that’s always a good idea.</h2>
<h3>
    <ul>
        Ingredients
    <li>Cucumbers: This bibimap recipe starts with cucumbers, cut into matchsticks, mixed with gochujang (optional, but it adds subtle heat).  </li>
    <li>Vegetables: You’ll also need spinach, cut into thin strips, and carrots, cut into matchsticks.</li>
    <li>Soy sauce: Soy sauce lends umami-rich flavor. </li>
    <li>Olive oil: Cook the carrots and garlic in olive oil. </li>
    <li>Seasonings: Take the flavor up a notch with fresh garlic and dried red pepper flakes.     </li>
    <li>Steak: This recipe calls for thinly-sliced beef — top round steak is rich and beefy, which makes it perfect for bibimbap.    </li>
    <li>Eggs: You’ll need one whole egg per serving.    </li>
    <li>Rice: Ladle each serving over bibimbap over a cup of cooked white rice.    </li>
    <li>Sesame oil: Toasting the sesame oil brings out a depth of flavor. </li>
    <li>Sesame seeds: A teaspoon of sesame seeds are the perfect finishing touch. </li>
    </ul>
